Malvon is a native, lightweight, WebKit-based web browser for macOS.

# About me
I have spent far too much time on this project, almost 4 years just rewriting browser after another. And certainly, this rewrite attempt has gotten me farther than all other rewrites. But I cannot keep doing the same thing again and again. I need to move on. I am discontinuing this web browser project because quite frankly, I dont give a shit about my battery life anymore. Enjoy the things you have, don't worry about the little bits like battery health after 2 years. Who the fuck cares? Why the fuck does that matter?

And so this is the final coffin.

I would like to show a little history:
- **March, 2020 (Before I had even reached puberty lol):** https://youtu.be/XWhcnIxrtMk?si=913j1NyxiQ7FLWaF

- **Feb 10, 2025:** The end. Someone may continue this project and I'd certainly love to see it! But I dont want to be confined to the same Swift Web Browser environment. 

Goodbye!!
