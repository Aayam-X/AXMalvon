## Features
To check the list of features, go through the [Development Log](./Log.md) and the [Source code](./AXMalvon/Sources/).

## Running the app
This application has Signup/Login windows, and are shown when built in production mode. To bypass this, either you comment out the code in the [App delegate](https://github.com/ashp0/Malvon/blob/main/AXMalvon/Sources/AppDelegate.swift#L36-L46) or compile in debug mode.
